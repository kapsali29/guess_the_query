A project that predicts flipkart queries (Hackerank challenge) 

Flipkart is a popular Indian e-commerce portal. One of the most common actions performed by users of the portal, is to use the search box and query for a brand, product or product-line. The search box then returns the best matching products which it can find - along with their prices, details, descriptions, etc.

We tried out twenty different search queries (specified below), and made a list of some of the product names which were returned in response to them. You are provided with a list of N names of products from this list. Your task is to guess, which search query each of them was returned in response to.
